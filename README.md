# MessangerApp
NOTE: Some of the code in this project may have been deprecated from when I created this (specifically the SMTP object created for sending emails).

This app was made for a school project about a year ago where we had 2-3 weeks to make whatever app we wanted. I have tried to make the app as bug-proof and as functional as possible but with the short time I had to make this app, not all aspects of the app are developed. I have blanked out some of the variables that contained sensitive information so, if you would like to use this app you need to go into the code and fill in the blanked out variables with the respective information (I have commented where things need to be filled in).
