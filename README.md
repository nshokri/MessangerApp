# MessangerApp
NOTE: This app is NOT complete and some of the code in this project may have been deprecated from when I created this (specifically the SMTP object created for sending emails).

This app was made for a school project about a year ago where we had 2-3 weeks to make whatever app we wanted. The focus on this project was to display our XAML app creating skills. I have tried to make the app as bug-proof and as functional as possible but with the short time I had to make this app, I focused mainly on creating the XAML (since that was the focus of the project), so not all aspects of the app are developed.
